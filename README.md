Inside BitsAndPieces I have the skeleton of the simplest app with login screen and navActivity which hosts a few fragment.

It's done with Dagger 2.+ , with AndroidInjector e.t.c. I mean with the newest version of the Dagger.

Also there:
1. Retrofit.
2. Mvvm.
3. LiveData.
4. Navigation.
5. RxJava.
